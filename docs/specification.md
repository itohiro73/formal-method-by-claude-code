# Application Specification

## Overview

The Distributed Banking System is a formally verified implementation of a core banking platform demonstrating:
- Thread-safe concurrent operations
- Distributed transaction consensus  
- Mathematical guarantees of correctness
- Functional programming principles

## Functional Requirements

### Account Management

#### Account Creation
- **Requirement**: System SHALL allow creation of accounts with unique identifiers
- **Precondition**: Account ID must not already exist
- **Postcondition**: Account created with non-negative initial balance
- **Invariant**: All account balances remain non-negative at all times

#### Account States
Accounts can exist in one of three states:
- **Active**: Normal operation, all transactions allowed
- **Frozen**: Temporary suspension, no transactions allowed  
- **Closed**: Permanent closure, balance must be zero

### Transaction Processing

#### Supported Transaction Types

1. **Deposits**
   - **Specification**: `deposit(account_id, amount) -> Result<new_balance>`
   - **Precondition**: `amount > 0 AND account.state = Active`
   - **Postcondition**: `new_balance = old_balance + amount`
   - **Atomicity**: Operation completes fully or not at all

2. **Withdrawals**
   - **Specification**: `withdraw(account_id, amount) -> Result<new_balance>`
   - **Precondition**: `amount > 0 AND amount <= balance AND account.state = Active`
   - **Postcondition**: `new_balance = old_balance - amount`
   - **Safety**: Insufficient funds transactions are rejected

3. **Transfers**
   - **Specification**: `transfer(from_id, to_id, amount) -> Result<(from_balance, to_balance)>`
   - **Precondition**: `amount > 0 AND from_id ≠ to_id AND amount <= from_balance`
   - **Postcondition**: Money conservation: `sum(all_balances) unchanged`
   - **Atomicity**: Both accounts updated or neither

## Safety Properties

### Formal Invariants

1. **Non-Negative Balances**
   ```haskell
   ∀ account ∈ system : balance(account) ≥ 0
   ```

2. **Money Conservation**
   ```haskell
   ∀ transaction : system_total_before = system_total_after + external_flows
   ```

3. **Account Consistency**
   ```haskell
   ∀ account : account.state = Closed ⟹ balance(account) = 0
   ```

4. **Transaction Atomicity**
   ```haskell
   ∀ transaction : transaction.status ∈ {Completed, Failed} ⟹ 
     (all_effects_applied ∨ no_effects_applied)
   ```

### Concurrency Safety

- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other
- **Consistency**: System maintains all invariants under concurrent access
- **Durability**: Completed transactions are permanent
- **Deadlock Freedom**: No circular waiting on resources

## Liveness Properties

### Progress Guarantees

1. **Transaction Completion**
   ```
   Every valid transaction request eventually receives a response
   ```

2. **Fair Scheduling**
   ```
   No transaction is indefinitely postponed
   ```

3. **Termination**
   ```
   All operations terminate in finite time
   ```

## Performance Requirements

### Throughput
- **Target**: 1000+ transactions per second per node
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with additional nodes (up to network limits)

### Latency
- **Local Operations**: < 1ms average response time
- **Distributed Operations**: < 100ms for consensus completion
- **Query Operations**: < 0.1ms for balance lookups

### Consistency
- **Eventual Consistency**: All nodes converge to same state within bounded time
- **Strong Consistency**: Critical operations (transfers) maintain immediate consistency

## Distributed System Requirements

### Consensus Protocol

#### Voting Mechanism
- **Majority Rule**: Transactions require > 50% node approval
- **Vote Types**: Yes, No, Abstain
- **Timeout**: Proposals expire after configurable timeout period

#### Fault Tolerance
- **Byzantine Resilience**: System tolerates up to (n-1)/3 malicious nodes
- **Network Partitions**: Maintains consistency during network splits
- **Node Recovery**: Failed nodes can rejoin and synchronize state

### Message Types
1. **Transaction Proposals**: New transaction requests for consensus
2. **Vote Messages**: Node votes on pending proposals
3. **Commit Messages**: Finalize approved transactions
4. **Heartbeat Messages**: Node health monitoring
5. **Join/Leave Messages**: Cluster membership changes

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Account Access**: Only authorized operations on specific accounts
- **Node Authentication**: Distributed nodes must authenticate to join cluster
- **Transaction Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of transaction messages

### Privacy
- **Balance Privacy**: Account balances not exposed unnecessarily  
- **Transaction Privacy**: Transaction details only visible to involved parties
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history for compliance

## Data Model

### Core Types

```haskell
-- Account representation
data Account = Account
  { accountId     :: AccountId
  , balance       :: Balance      -- Non-negative integer
  , accountState  :: AccountState -- Active | Frozen | Closed
  , createdAt     :: UTCTime
  , lastModified  :: UTCTime
  }

-- Transaction representation  
data Transaction = Transaction
  { transactionId   :: TransactionId
  , transactionType :: TransactionType -- Deposit | Withdrawal | Transfer
  , status          :: TransactionStatus -- Pending | Completed | Failed | Cancelled
  , timestamp       :: UTCTime
  , sourceAccount   :: Maybe AccountId
  , targetAccount   :: Maybe AccountId
  }

-- System state
data SystemInvariant = SystemInvariant
  { totalSystemBalance :: Balance
  , activeAccounts     :: [Account]
  , completedTxs       :: [Transaction]
  }
```

### Constraints

- **Balance Type**: Integer to avoid floating-point precision issues
- **Account IDs**: Unique strings for human-readable identification
- **Transaction IDs**: Globally unique identifiers for tracking
- **Timestamps**: UTC time for global coordination

## Error Handling

### Error Categories

1. **Validation Errors**
   - Invalid amounts (negative, zero)
   - Account not found
   - Insufficient funds

2. **State Errors**
   - Account not active
   - Transaction already processed
   - System invariant violation

3. **Concurrency Errors**
   - Transaction conflicts
   - Retry exhaustion
   - Deadlock detection

4. **Distributed Errors**
   - Network failures
   - Consensus timeout
   - Node unavailability

### Error Recovery

- **Automatic Retry**: Transient errors automatically retried with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality
- **Rollback**: Failed transactions automatically rolled back
- **Notification**: Critical errors generate alerts for administrator intervention

## Compliance & Auditing

### Regulatory Requirements
- **Transaction Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations
- **Data Retention**: Transaction history preserved per regulatory requirements
- **Reporting**: Generate compliance reports for regulatory submission

### Monitoring
- **Real-time Metrics**: Transaction rates, error rates, response times
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of system invariants
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for anomalies or failures

This specification provides the formal foundation for the banking system implementation, ensuring mathematical correctness and practical usability.
